# ZykovColor


This repository contains the code for the exact graph coloring algorithm **ZykovColor**,
presented in "A Customized SAT-based Solver for Graph Coloring".

The focus is a custom external propagator using the IPASIR-UP interface [[1]](#1)
to communicate information with the underlying SAT solver CaDiCal [[2]](#2).
It works on top of a Zykov-based SAT encoding for the graph coloring problem
and handles the transitivity constraints, can prune parts of the search with lower bounds,
and uses further techniques detailed in the paper to yield a competitive algorithm.
The presented propagator extends the ideas of [[3]](#3) and uses SAT instead of a CSP solver,
which also allows solving the decision problems incrementally and re-using information and learned clauses.

## Dependencies and Installation


We used version 2.1.2 of [CaDiCal](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical),
but any version with the same IPASIR-UP interface should work.
[Open-WBO](https://github.com/sat-group/open-wbo) is used
to build the incremental cardinality constraints with the Totalizer Encoding.
This is not strictly necessary for ZykovColor,
but we also support the option to explicitly add at-most-$k$-constraints.
[Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (Version 1.88.0 or higher) and ZLIB are also required,
and the path to a binary of [CliSAT](https://github.com/psanse/CliSAT) is needed
to compute an initial clique in preprocessing.
Additionally, to compute the fractional chromatic number in the propagator, 
we need to compile and link [exactcolors](https://github.com/heldstephan/exactcolors), which requires either cplex or gurobi.
The cmake currently uses only gurobi.

To help with the compilation process and the installation of the dependencies,
we provide a build script `build.sh`.
This only requires paths to Gurobi and Boost (version 1.88.0 or higher) and collects the remaining software itself.

```
export GUROBI_HOME=/path/tp/gurobi
export BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost
./build.sh
```
The resulting executable `ZykovColor` can be found in the folder `cmake-build`.

Alternatively, one can use existing or custom paths to the dependencies:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost -DOPENWBO_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/open-wbo -DCADICAL_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/cadical -DCLISAT_BINARY_PATH=/path/to/clisat/binary -DEXACTCOLORS_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/exactcolors -DGUROBI_HOME=/path/to/gurobi -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

## Usage

```
./ZykovColor inputfile [options] --configuration 
```
Where ``--configuration`` is one of the following:
- ``--zykov-color``
- ``--assignment``
- ``--partial-order``

They run either ZykovColor, the Assignment encoding, or the Partial Order encoding
in their default configuration as described in the paper.
For more custom options, see `Options.cpp`.
